# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification

This project:

* Analyze the Fashion-MNIST dataset, consisting of over 70,000 images across ten categories, to
develop a highly accurate image classification model.
* Apply PyTorch to build a multi-layer neural network model with ReLU and Softmax functions,
optimizing model performance using Cross-Entropy loss functions.
* Employed mini-batch stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms to parameterize and fine-
tune the model to achieve an accuracy of over 85% on the testing set.
